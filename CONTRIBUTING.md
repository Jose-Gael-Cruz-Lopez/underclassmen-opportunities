## What Qualifies as an Underclassmen Opportunity?

This repository is **specifically for programs that target freshmen and sophomores**—students who are typically in their first or second year of college.

### Target Classes

Opportunities submitted here should be designed for:
- **Class of 2028** (current freshmen)
- **Class of 2029** (current sophomores)

These are programs explicitly restricted to students early in their college career. If an opportunity is open to juniors, seniors, or anyone regardless of year, it belongs in [Summer2026-Internships](https://github.com/vanshb03/Summer2026-Internships) instead.

### Examples of What We Include

- **Microsoft Explore** - Designed specifically for freshmen and sophomores
- **Fellowships** like Code2040, MLH Fellowship that explicitly welcome underclassmen
- **Research programs** like REU, SURF that accept first and second-year students
- **Early talent/development programs** that restrict applications to classes 2028 or 2029

### What Does NOT Belong Here

- **General internships open to all years** - Use [Summer2026-Internships](https://github.com/vanshb03/Summer2026-Internships) instead
- **Opportunities accepting juniors or seniors** - These belong in the general listings
- **Full-time/new-grad positions** - For graduating students
- **Opportunities requiring significant prior experience** - Underclassmen programs should be accessible to early students

## Categories

Opportunities are organized into four sections:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Internship** | Traditional internship programs for underclassmen | Early talent programs from smaller companies |
| **Program** | Fellowships, externships, bootcamps | Code2040, MLH Fellowship, SEO Tech |
| **Research** | University/lab research programs | REU, SURF, NASA OSSI |
| **Scholarship** | Financial awards for underclassmen in tech | Company-sponsored scholarships |

## How the Automation Works

1. **User submits** a link via the issue template
2. **Maintainer reviews** and adds the `approved` label
3. **AI extracts** company, role, location, category, etc. from the page
4. **Automation adds** the opportunity to the correct table
5. **Issue is closed** with a summary of what was added

## Guidelines

- **Search existing issues** before submitting to avoid duplicates
- **Verify the opportunity** is specifically for underclassmen
- **Use official links** - no referral links or affiliate URLs
- Be respectful and help maintain accurate information
