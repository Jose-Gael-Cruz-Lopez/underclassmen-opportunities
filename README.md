Hi, I'm Jose. I created this repository as a curated list of internships, programs, and opportunities specifically designed for **freshmen and sophomores** (underclassmen) in tech, software engineering, and related fields.

I know how overwhelming the internship search can feel when you're just starting out. I don't want any underclassmen to feel left behind in their career journey. Many companies have programs specifically for first and second-year students that don't require prior experience, and I want to make sure everyone has access to these opportunities.

This is a community-driven space. I welcome contributions from anyone who wants to help fellow students succeed. If you find an opportunity, share it. If you learned something, pass it on. Together, we can make the path a little clearer for everyone.
